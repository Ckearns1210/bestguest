This project was a first attempt at a Rails application.  It is an application where a user can create an event, invite people (or give them permission) to view this event, and add items that he needs for the event, that the invitees can then claim.  It is made with dinner parties, potlucks, and BBQ's.

It uses CRUD methods, RESTful routing, and various types of Active Record Associations to create groups and permissions.  It also includes authentication with the bcrypt gem, sessions, and protection for routes that should not be accessed.  Styling was greatly helped by Bootstrap.
